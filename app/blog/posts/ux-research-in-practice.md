## Making Research Practical

Good research is intentional, time-boxed, and action-focused. You don't need 100 participants to learn something useful — a small, well-structured study will surface meaningful signals.

### Method: 5-Day Guerrilla Research

Plan interviews with 5–8 participants, define quick success criteria, and synthesize results into 3 prioritized recommendations.

### Sample Study

We conducted a study to understand the discoverability of key product features. The outcome: users missed advanced filtering tools, which led us to add a more visible filter bar and reduce task completion time by 33% in subsequent testing.

### Tools & Tips

- Use session recordings for behavior context.
- Structured note-taking templates speed up synthesis.
- Share short, visual artifacts (video snippets, quotes) with teams.

In short, keep research lightweight, focused, and documented so product teams can act on it.
